## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend JavaScript library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - CSS module bundler
- Mobile-first Workflow 

### Useful resources

- [Modular SCSS and Why You Need It](https://medium.com/clover-platform-blog/modular-scss-and-why-you-need-it-6bb2d8c40fd8), [How to Use Sass with CSS Modules in Next.js](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-sass-with-css-modules-in-next-js/) - Both articles brought to my attention how modular styling can improve the code maintainability experience and make it scalable. For that reason, I wanted to apply what I've learned, based on the architectures shown by the articles

- [Stop using @import with Sass](https://youtu.be/CR-a8upNjJ0), [Sass @import is being replaced](https://youtu.be/dOnYNEXv9BM) - As my first project using Dart Sass, I understood, with these videos, the problems of using @import and the new rules benefits/differences

- [React Accordion Using React Hooks](https://youtu.be/MAD2HnUFjgg) - I had my first contact with the useRef() hook through this video, which was very helpful for building the page accordion
